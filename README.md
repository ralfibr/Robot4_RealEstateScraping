# Robot4_RealEstateScraping

I am designed to help you easily scrape data from real estate websites and export it as an Excel file. Whether you're a real estate agent, investor, or simply interested in real estate data, I can save you time and effort by automating the data collection process.

Using advanced web scraping technology, I can collect data on properties, prices, locations, and other relevant information from various real estate websites. I then compile this data into an Excel file, making it easy for you to analyze and manipulate the data as needed.

In addition, I offer various customization options, allowing you to select which data fields you want to include in the Excel file, as well as which real estate websites you want to scrape.

To get started, simply input your preferred real estate websites and data fields, and I will take care of the rest. You can sit back and relax while I do the heavy lifting for you.
